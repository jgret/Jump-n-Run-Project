# Holy Jmpnrn

[1:1] In the beginning when God created the engine and the game,
[1:2] the engine was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the empty classes.
[1:3] Then God said, "Let there be graphics"; and there were graphics.
[1:4] And God saw that the graphics were fast; and God separated the graphics from the darkness.
[1:5] God called the graphics VolatileImage, and the darkness he called vBuffer. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
[1:6] And God said, "Let there be a Server in the midst of the engine, and let it separate the engine from the Server."
[1:7] So God made the Server and separated the mess that was under the engine from the Servers that were above the Servers. And it was so.
[1:8] God called the Server SAM. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
