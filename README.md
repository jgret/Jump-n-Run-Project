# Holy Jmpnrn

In the beginning when God created the engine and the game,
the engine was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the empty classes.
Then God said, "Let there be graphics"; and there were graphics.
And God saw that the graphics were fast; and God separated the graphics from the darkness.
God called the graphics VolatileImage, and the darkness he called vBuffer. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
And God said, "Let there be a Server in the midst of the engine, and let it separate the engine from the Server."
So God made the Server and separated the mess that was under the engine from the Servers that were above the engine. And it was so.
God called the Server SAM. And there was evening but there was no morning. And God saw the game was not good...
